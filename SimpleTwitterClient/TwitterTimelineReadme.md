> Implementation
==========================
*   User can sign in to Twitter using OAuth login.
*   User can view the tweets from their home timeline.
*   User should be able to see the username, name, body for each tweet.
*   User should see the relative timestamp for a tweet "8m", "7h".
*   User can view more tweets as they scroll with infinite pagination.
*   User can compose a new tweet by clicking a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right ("+" sign).
*   User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter.
*   User is taken back to home timeline with new tweet visible in timeline.
*   Error handling to check if internet is disconnected and retreive from database schema.

> Still Working
*   Links in tweets are clickable and will launch the web browser (see autolink)

> Problem
*   When internet is disconnected, the user image don't show always - need to solve it.
